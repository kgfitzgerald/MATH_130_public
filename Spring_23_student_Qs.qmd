# Content Questions

## Chapter 1

-   Why was telephone area code not ordinal?

    -   The categories (e.g. 469, 323, etc) don't have a natural order/ranking/hierarchy to them.

    -   For example, "bigger" area codes (larger numbers) aren't better than "smaller" area code in this case.

    -   The "size" of the area code doesn't have any meaning

## Chapter 2

-   What were the key takeaways about sampling again?

    -   Sampling bias is a feature of the sampling METHOD. That is, if your method is biased, you will end up with biased results

    -   Having a large sample size doesn't fix sampling bias - if your method is biased, you will still have biased results, even if you collect a lot of data

    -   Random sampling is the key to collecting unbiased samples.

-   What are some ways around sampling bias?

    -   **Random sampling!** Random sampling ensures we will NOT have sampling bias. That is, if we select a random sample of people (or other observational units) to be in our study, the summary statistics calculated from our data will be unbiased estimates of the corresponding true parameter values in the population

-   What's the difference between inference and exploratory analysis?

    -   Exploratory analysis = just exploring /analyzing/investigating the data in our SAMPLE (think: tasting a spoonful of soup)

    -   Inference = using the results from our sample to draw a general conclusion about the broader POPULATION (think: using the spoonfull to draw a conclusion about what the whole pot of soup tastes like)

-   Can you clarify associated vs independent?

    -   Associated = two variables are related to one another, if we visualized them we would see a pattern/trend. Some examples:

        -   Life expectancy and income

        -   Height and weight

        -   Hours of sleep and reported energy levels

    -   Independent = two variables are NOT related to one another, if we visualized them, we would NOT see a pattern/trend (if a scatterplot, would just see random scatter). Some examples:

        -   Eye color and what you ate for breakfast (e.g. people aren't more likely to choose certain breakfast foods just because their eyes are blue or brown - these two things are unrelated)

        -   Day of month you were born and how many hours of Netflix you watched

-   How does an observational study influence the variable?

    -   Observational study is more about *how* the data is collected (i.e. no random assignment), rather than *what* data (variables) are collected

    -   Observational studies also influence what conclusions we're allowed to draw (i.e. we cannot make causal conclusions based off of observational studies).

-   Are the explanatory and response variables interchangeable at times? There are some times when a question/prompt asks to identify which is which (like the one in the homework for this week) that asked whether the income rate or the bachelor degree was the explanatory vs response variable. That one confused me, because I thought the explanatory should have been the income level, since that was what the research was trying to discover... But based on the graph it was the opposite way

    -   Response = the main outcome variable the research is interested in

    -   Explanatory = the variable that might help explain something about the outcome/response

    -   In the income/education example:

        -   you correctly said income is "what the research was trying to discover" - but this makes it the response variable

        -   A person's education level generally helps explain something about their income level, making it the explanatory

    -   Also like you mentioned, checking a visualization is a good way to discern the difference. Response = y-axis, Explanatory = x-axis

    -   Another tip: which one occurs earlier in time? That's usually the explanatory. In this example, the education level is something in the past (a person already received a Bachelor's degree or they didn't), and it's helping to explain their income in the present.

## Group Quiz 1 Debrief

### Problem 1

Researchers studied whether metal bands used for tagging penguins are harmful to their survival. Researchers tagged 100 penguins with RFID chips, and then they randomly assigned half of the penguins to also receive a metal band. Researchers then kept track of which penguins survived throughout the study and which did not.

***How can we tell this is an experiment?***

-   Because there was random assignment

-   Careful: all experiments must have treatment and control, but just because there is a treatment/control, doesn't mean it's an experiment.

    -   Random assignment is the key distinguishing factor!

    -   There are many (bad) observational studies that are trying to investigate a treatment - these studies don't use random assignment, so they haven't accounted for confounding variables, and their results may be invalid

    -   Note, there are more sophisticated "quasi-experimental" methods for taking confounding variables into account in situations where random assignment is not possible, but we won't be covering them in this course :)

***Did the researchers use randomness in order to give all penguins the same chance of being selected for the study?***

-   This is asking: was random sampling used? That's the purpose of random sampling: to give all observational units the same chance of being selected for the study (which is what protects against sampling bias)

***Did the researchers use randomness in order to produce groups that were as similar as possible in all respects before the explanatory variable was imposed?***

-   This is asking: was random assignment used? That's the purpose of random assignment: to produce groups that are similar as possible before the treatment is imposed (which is what protects against confounding variables)

Note: implementing a well-designed study often requires more effort, planning, and $ than a poorly designed study. There are LOTS of bad studies out there. If we aren't explicitly told that randomness was used in a study design, we should assume it wasn't.

***The following answers received partial credit. Can you articulate why?***

-   Explanatory variable: harmfulness of the bands

-   Response variable: survival rate of the penguins

### Problem 2

Suppose that the observational units in a study are patients who entered the emergency room at Huntington Hospital in the previous week. For each of the following, indicate whether it is a categorical variable, a numerical variable, or not a variable with regard to these observational units.

***Why are the following NOT variables?***

-   Average wait time for the patient to be seen

-   Whether or not wait times tend to be longer on weekends than weekdays

### Problem 3

**Examples of variables that can be collected when Super Bowl games are the observational units:**

-   Team that won (categorical)

-   Total points scored (numerical)

-   Location of the game (categorical)

-   Viewership/# of people who watched (numerical)

**Examples of variables that can be collected when movies that won Best Picture are the observational units:**

-   \# of male actors in the film (numerical)

-   genre of the movie (categorical)

***Why are the following NOT variables for the above observational units:***

-   Average time length in movie

-   How many movies have won in each genre

-   \# of super bowl games played

**Examples of research questions**

-   Does the location of the game affect the total points scored?

-   How many teams played in their home stadium? Do teams that play in their home stadium tend to win more often?

-   What is the average viewership of the superbowl? Has viewership changed over time?

-   What movie genre has the most movies that have won Best Picture?

-   Is the team that scores first more likely to win?

-   Do movies starring more male actors tend to win the Academy Award for Best Picture more often?

**Tips for coming up with research questions:**

-   What is the relationship between \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_ ?

-   What is the average \_\_\_\_ ? (for numeric variables)

-   What proportion of \[observational units\] that \_\_\_\_\_\_ ? (for categorical variables)

-   Does \[this group\] tend to \_\_\_\_\_ more often than \[that group\]?

-   Does \_\_\_\_\_ change over time? (if you have data collected over time)

## Group Quiz 2 Debrief

### Problem 1

![](images/image-36863512.png)

![](images/julytemphist.png)

-   Difference between histogram & bar plot!

-   Histograms are displaying ONE numeric variable

    -   frequency / count on the y-axis is not a variable

    -   why we ONLY specify `aes(x = _____)` for `geom_histogram`

-   Observational units = cities, not temperatures, not days

-   Why is it incorrect to say the two clusters/peaks are high & low temperatures in July?

### Problem 2

Average house price is $425,000. Will more, less, or exactly 50% of houses cost more than the mean?

-   House-prices are right-skewed, so mean is larger than the median

-   Median = 50% split of the data, so if mean is above the median, \<50% will be above the mean

It is very possible for 90% of a company's employees to make less than the average.

-   July 2022 headline: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy earned 6,474 times the median Amazon employee\'s salary

-   $213,000,000 vs. $32,855

### Problem 3

![](images/dotplot.png)

-   Easiest to draw extreme cases - no spread vs. max spread

-   Two variables: whether or not you have children under 18, \# of movies

# Course Logistics Questions

## Week 2

-   Will the group quiz have definition questions?

    -   No, but you will be asked to apply definitions to answer questions

    -   For example, you won't be asked "what is an explanatory variable" but you might be given a research scenario and asked to identify the explanatory variable.

    -   Another example: you won't be asked "what's the difference between categorical and numerical variables"? but you might be asked to identify variables from a research scenario and classify them as categorical or numerical.
