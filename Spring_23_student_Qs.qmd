# Content Questions

## Chapter 1

-   Why was telephone area code not ordinal?

    -   The categories (e.g. 469, 323, etc) don't have a natural order/ranking/hierarchy to them.

    -   For example, "bigger" area codes (larger numbers) aren't better than "smaller" area code in this case.

    -   The "size" of the area code doesn't have any meaning

## Chapter 2

-   What were the key takeaways about sampling again?

    -   Sampling bias is a feature of the sampling METHOD. That is, if your method is biased, you will end up with biased results

    -   Having a large sample size doesn't fix sampling bias - if your method is biased, you will still have biased results, even if you collect a lot of data

    -   Random sampling is the key to collecting unbiased samples.

-   What are some ways around sampling bias?

    -   **Random sampling!** Random sampling ensures we will NOT have sampling bias. That is, if we select a random sample of people (or other observational units) to be in our study, the summary statistics calculated from our data will be unbiased estimates of the corresponding true parameter values in the population

-   What's the difference between inference and exploratory analysis?

    -   Exploratory analysis = just exploring /analyzing/investigating the data in our SAMPLE (think: tasting a spoonful of soup)

    -   Inference = using the results from our sample to draw a general conclusion about the broader POPULATION (think: using the spoonfull to draw a conclusion about what the whole pot of soup tastes like)

-   Can you clarify associated vs independent?

    -   Associated = two variables are related to one another, if we visualized them we would see a pattern/trend. Some examples:

        -   Life expectancy and income

        -   Height and weight

        -   Hours of sleep and reported energy levels

    -   Independent = two variables are NOT related to one another, if we visualized them, we would NOT see a pattern/trend (if a scatterplot, would just see random scatter). Some examples:

        -   Eye color and what you ate for breakfast (e.g. people aren't more likely to choose certain breakfast foods just because their eyes are blue or brown - these two things are unrelated)

        -   Day of month you were born and how many hours of Netflix you watched

-   How does an observational study influence the variable?

    -   Observational study is more about *how* the data is collected (i.e. no random assignment), rather than *what* data (variables) are collected

    -   Observational studies also influence what conclusions we're allowed to draw (i.e. we cannot make causal conclusions based off of observational studies).

-   Are the explanatory and response variables interchangeable at times? There are some times when a question/prompt asks to identify which is which (like the one in the homework for this week) that asked whether the income rate or the bachelor degree was the explanatory vs response variable. That one confused me, because I thought the explanatory should have been the income level, since that was what the research was trying to discover... But based on the graph it was the opposite way

    -   Response = the main outcome variable the research is interested in

    -   Explanatory = the variable that might help explain something about the outcome/response

    -   In the income/education example:

        -   you correctly said income is "what the research was trying to discover" - but this makes it the response variable

        -   A person's education level generally helps explain something about their income level, making it the explanatory

    -   Also like you mentioned, checking a visualization is a good way to discern the difference. Response = y-axis, Explanatory = x-axis

    -   Another tip: which one occurs earlier in time? That's usually the explanatory. In this example, the education level is something in the past (a person already received a Bachelor's degree or they didn't), and it's helping to explain their income in the present.

## Group Quiz 1 Debrief

### Problem 1

Researchers studied whether metal bands used for tagging penguins are harmful to their survival. Researchers tagged 100 penguins with RFID chips, and then they randomly assigned half of the penguins to also receive a metal band. Researchers then kept track of which penguins survived throughout the study and which did not.

***How can we tell this is an experiment?***

-   Because there was random assignment

-   Careful: all experiments must have treatment and control, but just because there is a treatment/control, doesn't mean it's an experiment.

    -   Random assignment is the key distinguishing factor!

    -   There are many (bad) observational studies that are trying to investigate a treatment - these studies don't use random assignment, so they haven't accounted for confounding variables, and their results may be invalid

    -   Note, there are more sophisticated "quasi-experimental" methods for taking confounding variables into account in situations where random assignment is not possible, but we won't be covering them in this course :)

***Did the researchers use randomness in order to give all penguins the same chance of being selected for the study?***

-   This is asking: was random sampling used? That's the purpose of random sampling: to give all observational units the same chance of being selected for the study (which is what protects against sampling bias)

***Did the researchers use randomness in order to produce groups that were as similar as possible in all respects before the explanatory variable was imposed?***

-   This is asking: was random assignment used? That's the purpose of random assignment: to produce groups that are similar as possible before the treatment is imposed (which is what protects against confounding variables)

Note: implementing a well-designed study often requires more effort, planning, and $ than a poorly designed study. There are LOTS of bad studies out there. If we aren't explicitly told that randomness was used in a study design, we should assume it wasn't.

***The following answers received partial credit. Can you articulate why?***

-   Explanatory variable: harmfulness of the bands

-   Response variable: survival rate of the penguins

### Problem 2

Suppose that the observational units in a study are patients who entered the emergency room at Huntington Hospital in the previous week. For each of the following, indicate whether it is a categorical variable, a numerical variable, or not a variable with regard to these observational units.

***Why are the following NOT variables?***

-   Average wait time for the patient to be seen

-   Whether or not wait times tend to be longer on weekends than weekdays

### Problem 3

**Examples of variables that can be collected when Super Bowl games are the observational units:**

-   Team that won (categorical)

-   Total points scored (numerical)

-   Location of the game (categorical)

-   Viewership/# of people who watched (numerical)

**Examples of variables that can be collected when movies that won Best Picture are the observational units:**

-   \# of male actors in the film (numerical)

-   genre of the movie (categorical)

***Why are the following NOT variables for the above observational units:***

-   Average time length in movie

-   How many movies have won in each genre

-   \# of super bowl games played

**Examples of research questions**

-   Does the location of the game affect the total points scored?

-   How many teams played in their home stadium? Do teams that play in their home stadium tend to win more often?

-   What is the average viewership of the superbowl? Has viewership changed over time?

-   What movie genre has the most movies that have won Best Picture?

-   Is the team that scores first more likely to win?

-   Do movies starring more male actors tend to win the Academy Award for Best Picture more often?

**Tips for coming up with research questions:**

-   What is the relationship between \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_ ?

-   What is the average \_\_\_\_ ? (for numeric variables)

-   What proportion of \[observational units\] that \_\_\_\_\_\_ ? (for categorical variables)

-   Does \[this group\] tend to \_\_\_\_\_ more often than \[that group\]?

-   Does \_\_\_\_\_ change over time? (if you have data collected over time)

## Chapter 4

-   When will we ever have to use a mosaic plot to organize data?

    -   Mosaic plots are useful anytime you're trying to investigate the relationship between *two categorical variables,* especially when the sample size (number of observations) is not equal in each category

    -   In this class, you won't need to create mosaic yourselves (although code is provided in Lab 02 to create one), but you should be able to interpret them

## Group Quiz 2 Debrief

### Problem 1

![](images/image-36863512.png)

![](images/julytemphist.png)

-   Difference between histogram & bar plot!

-   Histograms are displaying ONE numeric variable

    -   frequency / count on the y-axis is not a variable

    -   why we ONLY specify `aes(x = _____)` for `geom_histogram`

-   Observational units = cities, not temperatures, not days

-   Why is it incorrect to say the two clusters/peaks are high & low temperatures in July?

### Problem 2

Average house price is $425,000. Will more, less, or exactly 50% of houses cost more than the mean?

-   House-prices are right-skewed, so mean is larger than the median

-   Median = 50% split of the data, so if mean is above the median, \<50% will be above the mean

It is very possible for 90% of a company's employees to make less than the average.

-   July 2022 headline: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy earned 6,474 times the median Amazon employee's salary

-   $213,000,000 vs. $32,855

### Problem 3

![](images/dotplot.png)

-   Easiest to draw extreme cases - no spread vs. max spread

-   Two variables: whether or not you have children under 18, \# of movies

## Lab 02

-   Question on the bonus: we were supposed to have only flights whose carriers were "AA", "DL", or "UA", but in the LAB when inputting `filter(carrier == "AA", "DL", "UA"` it said that it was unable to accomplish it, so I tried inputting `filter(carrier == "AA", carrier == "DL", carrier == "UA"`. However, this rendered the dataset to have 0 variables, since no observational units would contain all three categories within them. So I had to list the reverse, and use the "!=" symbol to list everything that it *wasn't.* So, long story short, I want to know how to do that in an easier way, because listing everything it wasn't took much longer than being able to list the few that I did want. So how would I do that?

    -   Love the question! Two options:

        -   the symbol `|` means "or", so we could do `filter(carrier == "AA" | carrier == "DL"| carrier == "UA")`

        -   Utilize the function `%in%` to search within a list of options: `filter(carrier %in% c("AA", "DL", "UA"))`

-   How will you know if a graph will be skewed left or right based on the summary statistics alone?

    -   Recall what you know about the mean and median in skewed data: the mean gets pulled in the direction of the skew, so:

        -   Mean \> median indicates it is right-skewed

        -   Mean \< median indicates it is left-skewed

    -   

## Chapter 7

-   What is the intercept important for?

    -   In statistics, the slope is usually of more interest (it quantifies the relationship between x and y)

    -   However, mathematically, we still have to have an intercept to define a line (think back to algebra: y = mx + b)

-   Can we please go over regression lines and calculating correlation?

    -   Regression line: *ŷ* = *b*<sub>0</sub> + *b*<sub>1</sub>*x*

    -   Correlation:

        -   Calculated as square root of *R*<sup>2</sup>. That is, $R = \sqrt{R^2}$

        -   It will always have the same sign ( + /−) as the slope. So make sure to put a negative sign in front of $\sqrt{R^2}$ if the slope is negative (your calculator will always just give you a positive number when you take the square root)

## Group Quiz 3 Debrief

### Problem 2

-   Data on heights were originally collected in centimeters, and then converted to inches. Does this conversion affect the correlation between partners' heights? Explain briefly.
    -   Correlation is UNITLESS
    -   This is an example of needing to apply a concept to reason about a problem in a new context

### Problem 3

-   Suppose we fit a regression line to predict an Instagram post's number of likes from the posting account's number of followers. For a particular post, we predict the number of views to be 437, and the residual for this is 14. Did we overestimate or underestimate the number of likes? Explain briefly.
    -   *e*<sub>*i*</sub> = *y*<sub>*i*</sub> − *ŷ*<sub>*i*</sub>
    -   residual = observed - predicted
    -   14 = *y*<sub>*i*</sub> − 437

### Problem 5

![](images/height_girth.png)

|     | term        | estimate | std.error | statistic | p.value  |
|-----|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
|     | <chr>       | <dbl>    | <dbl>     | <dbl>     | <dbl>    |
| 1   | (Intercept) | 105.9    | 1.02      | 6.79      | 1.61e-11 |
| 2   | shoulder    | 0.608    | 0.0304    | 31.9      | 3.78e-17 |

**What's wrong with the following answers?**

-   *ŷ* = *b*<sub>0</sub> + *b*<sub>1</sub>*x* for the regression equation
-   "*b*<sub>0</sub> = 105.9" for interpretation of the slope
-   "When x = 0, we expect y to equal 105.9 on average"

**How to calculate the correlation coefficient?**

-   The way to undo a "square" is to take the SQUARE ROOT
-   $R = \sqrt{R^2}$
-   Pay attention to the sign! Should match the sign of the slope

**How to interpret the correlation coefficient?**

-   As \[x\] increases, \[y\] tends to \[increase/decrease\]
-   There is a \[weak/moderately strong/strong\] \[positive/negative\] linear relationship between \[x\] and \[y\]

# Course Logistics Questions

## Week 2

-   Will the group quiz have definition questions?

    -   No, but you will be asked to apply definitions to answer questions

    -   For example, you won't be asked "what is an explanatory variable" but you might be given a research scenario and asked to identify the explanatory variable.

    -   Another example: you won't be asked "what's the difference between categorical and numerical variables"? but you might be asked to identify variables from a research scenario and classify them as categorical or numerical.

-   What do you consider excused vs. non-excused absence? And if we ever have to miss, how should we make it up?

    -   Generally, if you let me know in advance, it's excused

    -   You're responsible for all material covered in a class period - so make sure to watch the lecture recording (only available if you tell me you'll be gone in advance)

    -   No make-up quizzes unless coordinated with me in advance. If you do arrange a make-up, you have to take it by yourself instead of in a group.

## Week 5

-   Can I make up the quiz I missed?

    -   If you communicate with me in advance and have an excused absence, you can schedule a make-up quiz

    -   All other circumstances, make-ups are not allowed.

    -   It's important for your learning and out of courtesy to your group members that you are present on the day of a quiz

    -   In the event that you have to make up the quiz, know that it will be done individually and not in a group

    -   In all circumstances, you must schedule the make-up quiz before solutions are discussed, which is usually the class period following the quiz

-   Where can I get more help on the labs?

    -   Utilize your Lab Guide - all code needed for the lab is included in the guide, as well as some hints for what the exercises are asking

    -   Tutoring Center (LOTS of hours - see Canvas)

-   Will there be any more class-time spent on Lab 02?

    -   No - see above for other opportunities for help

    -   In general, only one class period will be dedicated to work on each lab. It is expected that you will work on the lab outside of class in order to complete it (it's an assignment)

-   Can you post the tutoring hours again?

    -   They can be found [here on Canvas](https://canvas.apu.edu/courses/45159/pages/free-tutoring).

## Week 6

-   Will any of the concepts from Lab 02 be on Lab 03?

    -   Probably! The general code you've been learning for creating visualizations, filtering data, creating new variables, etc will continue to be relevant in future labs

    -   However, you will be using new datasets, and using R to accomplish new data analysis/statistical tasks each time. So for example, in Lab 03 you will apply regression analyses learned in Chapter 7, and in Lab 04 you will apply methods learned in Chapter 13

-   Is there any way I can make up the labs for partial credit?

    -   Labs are accepted up to 1 week late (with a 5% deduction each day its late)

    -   Labs will remain a 0 if not turned in 7 days after deadline

    -   However, if you are facing any unusual or long-term life circumstances that are interfering with your ability to engage academically, come talk to me, and we can determine appropriate accommodations and a path forward

-   Is there a time we can review the material we learned this week?

    -   All of Week 7 will be re-iterating the concepts learned in Week 6 (regression):

        -   Lab 03 (Tuesday) will be using regression to analyze data in R (we'll start with a quick review of the main concepts)

        -   We'll have a Kahoot review before the Group Quiz over Chapter 7 on Thursday

-   Will we get packets or worksheets for future lectures?

    -   Will go back to slides as the main mode of content delivery after Chapter 7, but will continue to provide chapter highlight handouts as well as occasional activity worksheets

    -   Will see more handout type lecture material in Chapters 16 - 20

## Week 7

-   Will Lab 04 include questions about chapter 7?

    -   No. Lab 03 is focused on regression (Ch 7), Lab 04 will be focused on content from Chapter 13

-   Is the delay of Lab 03 going to have an effect on the total \# of labs?

    -   Nope! Believe it or not, there is only one more lab left! Lab 04, which will be in Week 10
