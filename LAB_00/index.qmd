## Introduction

In this lab, you will begin to familiarize yourself with the statistical
software we will be using this semester. The last Exercise on this lab
gives instructions for how to turn in your completed lab on Canvas.

***Before beginning this lab, make sure you have completed the steps on
the "Posit Cloud - Getting Started" to sign up for a Posit Cloud account
join our workspace for this course***

## Some lingo

-   **R** is the name of the statistical software / programming language
    you'll be learning in MATH 130 this semester
-   **RStudio** is a convenient interface for using the R programming
    language.
-   **Posit Cloud** is the online version of RStudio that we'll be using
    in MATH 130
-   **Quarto** is a type of document (with file extension .qmd) that is
    great for communicating results of a data analysis.

::: {.callout-note title="Learning Objectives" appearance="minimal"}

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

-   Identify the main components of the RStudio Interface
-   Use Quarto to render an html document
-   Execute code in code chunks in an Quarto document
-   Create objects in R
-   Turn in your completed lab as a .html file 

:::

## Getting Started

For each lab this semester, you will have a set of online instructions
(the webpage you're currently viewing is the Lab 00 instructions) that
will walk you through a data analysis via a series of exercises to be
completed in Posit Cloud.

::: {.callout-important}

#### Action required

To get started on Lab 00:

1.  Log-in to Posit Cloud and navigate to the MATH_130_F24 workspace
2.  Click "Start" on Lab 00
3.  In the Files pane (lower right quadrant), click the file
    "Lab_00.qmd" to open it

:::

The .qmd (Quarto document) should open in the source quadrant (upper
left) and look something like the screenshot below:

![](rstudio_interface.png)

The RStudio Interface is made up of four main quadrants:

1.  **Source:** where you actually type your code / answers

2.  **Console:** where the code & (non-visual) output will appear when
    you run the code

3.  **Environment:** where you can see the "objects" or datasets you
    have to work with

4.  **Files:** where you can open your .qmd file and export your .html
    file

::: {.callout-important}

#### Action required

When getting started in a Lab in Posit Cloud, you should always make two
quick settings changes. Find the gear/sprocket icon next to the
**Render** button (on the same line as the save, spellcheck, and search
icons), then:

1.  Click the gear/sprocket icon and then select **Preview in Viewer
    Pane**.

2.  Click the gear/sprocket icon again and select **Chunk Output in
    Console**

:::

## Render: Quarto --\> HTML

You will be completing your Lab in a Quarto document (.qmd). We can
**Render** an .html document from this file. Note, HTML is what's behind
EVERYTHING you view on the internet. So, you're basically about to
create your first web page :)

::: {.callout-important}

#### Action required

1.  Click the **Render** button above the top left pane in RStudio to
    generate an html version of your quarto document.

-   If you see a pop-up that indicates that packages need to be
    installed for the render to work, select the option to install the
    packages.

-   After the appropriate packages are installed the html file should
    appear in the Viewer pane on the right. Congratulations! You've
    rendered your first html file.

## Why Quarto?

Organizing and communicating your work is an extremely important aspect
of any science. In most cases that is the main objective of statistical
work. We want to take data and use it to build understanding and insight
into the world around us. RStudio makes the process of organizing and
communicating work with data much easier by using Quarto.

*How does Quarto make it easier?*

Quarto allows us to render documents that include both written content
and output from embedded R code. That is, we can do both computational
work and writing about results in one document --- this saves us from a
lot of tedious work and errors! No more copying and pasting!

Note, there are two ways to view and edit a Quarto document: Source or
Visual. You will likely feel most comfortable in the Visual mode, as it
looks and feels much like a Microsoft Word or Google Docs text editor.
However, switching to the Source mode allows you to view the underlying
code and syntax that generates the desired formatting (e.g. bold,
italics, headers, etc).

### Your First Data Visualization

Below is code to produce your first data visualization. Don't worry
about the details of the code for now - we'll learn that throughout the
semester. For now, start by answering a few questions about what you see
in the visualization.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gapminder <- gapminder::gapminder

gapminder_filtered <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("United States", "Canada", "Mexico"))

ggplot(data = gapminder_filtered) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  ylim(0, 90) +
  theme_minimal()
```

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 1"}

*You should type your answers to this exercise in your Lab_00.qmd
document in Posit Cloud*

a. What do you notice about the graph? What's on the x- and y-axes?
What do the colors represent? What patterns do you see?

b. What do you wonder? What questions does it raise?

:::

::: {.callout-important}

#### Action required

1.  After typing your answers to Exercise 1 in your Quarto document,
    click Render so that your answers appear in the .html document. The
    html document is what gets turned in and graded, so you must Render
    in order for your answers to be visible.
2.  Copy the code above and paste it into the code chunk below Exercise 1
    in your Quarto document.
3.  Press the "Play" button on the top right corner of the code chunk to
    load the necessary packages & data, and to produce the graph on your
    own computer. The graph should pop up in the "Plots" tab of the
    lower right quadrant.
4.  Check your "Environment" quadrant (top right). You should see two
    objects listed there now: `gapminder` (1704 rows & 6 columns) as
    well as `gapminder_filtered` (36 rows & 6 columns). These contain
    the data that produced the visualization.
5.  Double click on a dataset in your Environment to view it as a
    spreadsheet in your Source quadrant.

:::

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 2"}

a. After viewing the data in spreadsheet form, comment on what's
contained in the `gapminder` and `gapminder_filtered` datasets. Try to
explain how what's in the `gapminder_filtered` dataset relates to the
code that you copied and pasted.

b. Tweak the relevant code to add a 4th country to your visualization.

    + Click Render so that the updated visualization appears in your html.

    + Comment on what you observe in your updated visualization and any additional questions it makes you curious about.

## Embedding R Code

You've now seen your first example of how to embed R code into an Quarto
document. Embedded code is always placed in what's called a "code
chunk," which appears as a grey box. The first line of the code chunk
will also always include `r` inside a set of brackets to tell Quarto
that the code you've written is in the R programming language. Quarto is
multi-lingual and allows you to run code that's written in other
languages such as Python, Julia, SQL, etc., but we won't be doing that
in this course!

The html also includes the output from the code, immediately after the
code itself.

### Helpful Tip

**Anytime you get an `object not found`** or `function not found`
**error, your first trouble-shooting step should be to click the "Fast
Forward" button next to the Play button (green arrow in a code chunk),
then click Play to re-run the desired code chunk.** Often code in one
chunk depends on code in a previous chunk, so the Fast Forward button
quickly runs all code chunks above the current one. You do ***not***
need to hit the Fast Forward button *every* time before the Play button,
it should just be your first troubleshooting step if you get an error.

### Creating objects in R

"Objects" are the term for where values are saved in R. We assign values
to objects using the "assignment operator" `<-`. For example, we can
assign the value `9` to the object `x` with the code `x <- 9`. You can
think of the assignment operator as an arrow pointing left; it takes the
value on the right, and saves it into the object on the left.

::: {.callout-important}

#### Action required

1. Scroll to the relevant "Creating Objects in R" section in your .qmd, and run the following code chunk by clicking the green arrow on the right
hand side of the code chunk.

```{r}
x <- 9
```

2. Check the "Environment" pane (the top-right pane in your RStudio
window), and you should see that it now includes the object `x`. This
means that R now knows what `x` is, and you can use `x` to perform other
operations. Run the code chunk below and examine the output. 
3. Play around with other operations you can perform with `x` (e.g. division, subtraction, etc.)

```{r}
x*2
```

:::

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 3"}

In the code chunk for Exercise 3 in your .qmd, 

a. write a line of code that multiplies x by your favorite number
b. write a line of code that creates an object `y` and assigns it the value `437`. *Hint: see the code chunk above for how we created the object y*
c. write a line of code that calculate x*y. Make sure the correct answer (3933) appears in your html when you Render.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 4"}

Let's make some adjustments to the meta-data (called the YAML) at the top of the .qmd document:

a.  Add "MATH 130 - Introduction to Statistics" as a subtitle. Hint
    `subtitle:` goes right below `title:`.
b.  Change the author to your name.
c.  Change the date to the due date.

Render the document to observe how these changes appear in the .html.

:::

::: {.callout-note title="Exercise 5"}

Once Exercises 1-4 have been completed, Render the document one last
time. Look over the .html document (in the Viewer pane) to make sure
that everything is visible and formatted as you intended.

To submit this lab assignment, you need to export your .html document
from Posit Cloud and then upload it to the Lab 00 assignment on Canvas.

To export the file,

-   Navigate to the Files pane in Posit Cloud (bottom right quadrant, to
    the left of the Viewer tab)

-   Select the box next to the appropriate file name in the Files
    quadrant

-   Click "More" (blue gear icon), and then "Export"

The file will export to the downloads file on your computer. To submit
on Canvas, follow these steps:

-   In the MATH 130 Canvas site, navigate to Lab 00 under Assignments

-   Click "Start Assignment"

-   Click "Upload File"

-   Click "Choose File"

-   In the pop-up window, navigate to your Downloads folder and select
    "Lab_00.html"

-   Click "Submit Assignment"
