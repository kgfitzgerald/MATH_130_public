**Group Quiz 2 Debrief**

-   What is one way we can ensure "yes" has a smaller standard deviation than "no"?

-   What are the observational units? Think: what does one dot represent?

    -   Re-read the problem text: "*Suppose that you re-create this study by interviewing faculty at your school, and suppose that your sample contains 8 people in each group (16 total)"*

-   What are the variables?

    -   General Tip: look at x- and y-axis, and any other way the visualization is broken down/split into categories. Be careful with histograms though - counts/frequencies aren't variables.

    -   Why aren't "with children under 18" and "without children under 18" two variables?

    -   Why is "\# of children" incorrect?

    -   Why is "\# of people with children" incorrect?

    -   General tip: an axis typically will only show 1 variable (not several), and if you see what you think is multiple variables on the same axis, it is likely multiple categories of 1 categorical variable:

-   What are the observational units in the boxplots above?

    -   *"Data was collected on high temperatures for **each day of the month** during February and July in 4 different California cities"*

-   What about California is causing the two peaks?

    -   Why is night vs. afternoon not a correct explanation here? Think: what are the observational units?

-   What are the observational units and variables in the above histogram?

    -   Think: there are multiple numbers being plotted here. Where do those multiple numbers come from?

    -   *"The following graph displays high temperature data for cities around California on a particular day in July"*

-   Recall classification of variables:

    -   Numeric - can be discrete or continuous

    -   Categorical - can be ordinal or not ordinal

    -   Can't have categorical - discrete, for example
