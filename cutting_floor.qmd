*What is the difference between unbiased and random?*

-   Random sampling is an unbiased sampling method. Meaning, we will hit the right target, on average.

-   For example, random sampling fixes the Gettysburg address problem, and would give an unbiased estimate of the population mean.

-   BUT, there are lots of other types of bias:

    -   non-response bias (people who don't opt into the study)

    -   attrition bias (people drop out of study)

    -   bias of estimators (formulas we use)

    -   coverage bias (we only have a list of a subset of units in our population)

    -   etc

-   *Can large samples with unbiased methods still result in biased results?*

    -   Yes, maybe random sampling is used, and unbiased estimators (formulas) are used, but results can still suffer from a different type of bias (e.g. coverage bias)

-   *Can random assignment still have some sort of bias?*

    -   Random sampling: takes care of sampling bias, and allows us to generalize to the population from which we drew our sample

    -   Random assignment: takes care of confounding variables, and allows us to make causal claims

-   

-   *What's the easiest way to find standard deviation?*

    -   Using R :) never have to calculate it by hand. R has a built in function `sd()` that computes it for us
