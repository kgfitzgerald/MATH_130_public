## **Group Quiz 3 Debrief**

Eduardo and Rosie are both collecting data on number of rainy days in a year and the total rainfall for the year. Eduardo records rainfall in inches and Rosie in centimeters. How will their correlation coefficients compare? Explain your reasoning.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(openintro)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
nycflights <- nycflights %>% 
  mutate(air_time_hours = air_time/60)

ggplot(nycflights, aes(x = distance, y = air_time)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(nycflights, aes(x = distance, y = air_time_hours)) +
  geom_point()

nycflights %>% 
  summarise(cor_1 = cor(distance, air_time),
            cor_2 = cor(distance, air_time_hours))
```

### Regression problem

The following regression output is for predicting the heart weight (Hwt, in g) of cats from their body weight (Bwt, in kg). The coefficients are estimated using a dataset of 144 domestic cats.

-   What are the observational units?

    -   Why is "heart and body weight" incorrect?

-   What are the explanatory and response variables?

-   Write out the linear model

-   Interpret the intercept (make sure to include units)

-   Interpret the slope (make sure to include units)

-   The *R*<sup>2</sup> of this model is 65%. Interpret *R*<sup>2</sup>

-   Calculate the correlation coefficient and interpret it

## Other Student Qs

-   Confused about residuals

-   Confused about random sampling vs random assignment

-   What is the linear model and what is it used for?
